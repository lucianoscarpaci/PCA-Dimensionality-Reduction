# PCA-Dimensionality-Reduction
This project demonstrates PCA dimensionality reduction techniques and applies various classifiers such as KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and LDA on the Colon Cancer dataset. It includes two Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and results.

## Project Structure
- PCA-Classification.ipynb: Classification using KNN, Naive Bayes, Bayes, SVM, and LDA. Plotting of Accuracy VS. Number of Components. Plotting of Kmeans Clustering and Expectation Maximization of the features.

- PCA-Dimension-Reduction.ipynb: Dimensionality reduction using PCA and KPCA using RBF, Poly, and Linear Kernels. Plotting of Kmeans and Expectation Maximization clustering of Projected Compoents.

## Overview
This project showcases the utilization of PCA dimensionality reduction methods and the implementation of multiple classifiers including KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and LDA on the Colon Cancer dataset. It comprises two Jupyter notebooks containing comprehensive analyses and outcomes.
